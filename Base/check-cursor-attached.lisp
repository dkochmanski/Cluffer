;;;; This file contains definitions of :BEFORE methods on generic
;;;; functions that may take an attached CURSOR as one of the
;;;; arguments.  The :BEFORE method checks that the cursor is attached
;;;; and if not, signals an error of type CURSOR-DETACHED.

;;; NAME is the name of a generic function to which the method should
;;; be added.  ARGUMENTS is a lambda list that may contain lambda-list
;;; keywords.  A parameter named CURSOR is treated specially in that a
;;; specializer is added to it in the method lambda list generated by
;;; this macro.
